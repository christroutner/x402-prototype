# x402-prototype

This is a disposable code repository. It's purpose is to help me learn the client and server
interaction of the x402 protocol.

## 01-sovereign-base-sepolia

This example combines the x402 examples from Coinbase with [this fork of x402-soverign](https://github.com/christroutner/x402-sovereign), to run an Express server and interact with it using an Axios client to pay for endpoint access with USDC on the Base Sepolia network. x402-soverign fork allows me to run my own facilitator, without any dependence on Coinbase.

## 02-bch-prototype

This code is stale. The examples have been moved to the [x402-bch repository](https://github.com/x402-bch/x402-bch).
